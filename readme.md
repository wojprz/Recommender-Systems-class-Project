Project consists of two Jupyter notebooks. First one is **project_1_data_preparation.ipynb** that notebook contains data preparation from part one. Second one with file name **project_2_recommender_and_evaluation.ipynb** contains NNRecommender body and tuning methods.
Project also contains data preprocessing code:
* data_preprocessing/data_ppreprocessing_toolkit.py
* data_preprocessing/dataset_specification.py
* data_preprocessing/people_identifier.py
Project uses **data/hotel_data/hotel_data_original.csv** as data source.
